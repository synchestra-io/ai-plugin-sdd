## TL;DR

**Spec Kit** is GitHub's officially-published toolkit for **Spec-Driven Development (SDD)**. Python `specify` CLI, MIT, ~92k stars, ~138 releases, 100+ community extensions, integrates with 30+ AI coding agents (Claude Code, Copilot, Cursor, Gemini CLI, etc.). The workflow is a fixed seven-step funnel:

```
/speckit.constitution → /speckit.specify → /speckit.clarify → /speckit.plan
                     → /speckit.tasks   → /speckit.analyze → /speckit.implement
```

Output is a `.specify/specs/{N}-{name}/` tree of **prose markdown** files (`spec.md`, `plan.md`, `tasks.md`, `data-model.md`, `contracts/api-spec.json`). Spec Kit ships **a methodology, a template stack, and a plugin API** — but no formal schema for the specs themselves, no multi-agent coordination, and no async execution plane.

**Recommendation: integrate, don't compete.** Spec Kit is the on-ramp; Synchestra is the runway. The smart move is to publish two artifacts into Spec Kit's official ecosystem:

1. **`speckit-specscore` preset** — replaces Spec Kit's prose templates with SpecScore-structured ones (machine-readable spec/plan/task), and adds an `after_*` lint hook so every Spec Kit run produces validated SpecScore.
2. **`speckit-synchestra` extension** — adds `speckit.synchestra.claim`, `.status`, `.complete`, `.handoff` commands plus an `after_tasks` hook that enqueues the generated task list into a Synchestra state repo for multi-agent, multi-session, async execution.

Both ride Spec Kit's distribution (92k stars, GitHub blessing, 30 agents) instead of fighting it. The competitive surface that's left — **portable open standard, multi-agent coordination, async execution, schema validation** — is the part Spec Kit explicitly does not solve.

---

## 1. The Two Products Side-by-Side

| | Spec Kit | SpecScore + Synchestra |
|---|---|---|
| **Purpose** | Methodology toolkit: turn vague intent into a spec, plan, and task list. | Substrate: machine-readable spec format + multi-agent/async execution coordination. |
| **Core artifact** | `.specify/specs/{N}-{name}/spec.md` (prose markdown, no schema) | SpecScore tree: features → plans → tasks (Markdown + YAML, schema-validated) |
| **Workflow** | Fixed 7-command funnel | Open: SpecScore is format-only; Synchestra is the orchestration layer |
| **Spec format** | Informal markdown templates with `[NEEDS CLARIFICATION]` markers | Versioned schema, validator (`specscore spec lint`), LSP, linter |
| **Coordination** | Single-session: one agent runs `/speckit.implement` to completion | Optimistic-locking on a state repo; many agents/sessions/machines in parallel |
| **Execution** | Synchronous, local, in the user's IDE/terminal | Local, daemon, or remote via Hub (close laptop → work continues) |
| **Distribution** | `uv tool install specify-cli` (Python) | `curl … \| sh` single Go binary |
| **Plugin model** | First-class: extensions (new commands + lifecycle hooks), presets (template overrides) | Skills library, archetypes, MCP — but no third-party plugin registry yet |
| **Stars / maturity** | ~92k stars, 138 releases, 100+ community extensions | Pre-1.0, narrow audience, ~no community plugins |
| **Backed by** | GitHub | Independent OSS |
| **License** | MIT | Apache-2.0 (CLIs); CC BY 4.0 (SpecScore spec text) |

**One-sentence framing:** Spec Kit is a **template stack with a slash-command funnel**; Synchestra is **a coordination protocol** for what Spec Kit produces.

---

## 2. Where Spec Kit Is Stronger

These are real advantages we cannot out-build alone.

### 2.1. Distribution (the only one that really matters)
GitHub-published, ~92k stars, listed on every "AI coding workflow" roundup since launch. Synchestra-marketing budget can't beat that. Anything we ship as a Spec Kit extension inherits that funnel for free.

### 2.2. 30+ agent integrations out of the box
`specify init --integration claude|copilot|cursor|gemini|codex|qwen|tabnine|…` writes the right slash-command files into the right directory for each agent. We currently support Claude Code well; Cursor and others are best-effort. Spec Kit's per-agent install logic is a moat.

### 2.3. The `/speckit.constitution` and `/speckit.clarify` rituals
Two practices Synchestra doesn't have a first-class equivalent for:
- **Constitution** — project-level governing principles file (`.specify/memory/constitution.md`), authored before any spec is written, referenced by every later command.
- **Clarify** — structured coverage-based questioning to surface ambiguity *before* planning. Forces the agent to interrogate the user instead of guessing.

Both are mechanically simple; both are real ideas worth borrowing.

### 2.4. Plugin architecture is shipped, not roadmap
`extension.yml` manifest schema (1.0), strict namespacing (`speckit.{ext-id}.{cmd}`), `before_*` / `after_*` hooks for every core command, template override layer via presets, four-tier resolution priority (project overrides → presets → extensions → core). A real, documented SPI. Synchestra has nothing comparable today.

### 2.5. Community velocity
100+ community extensions exist (MAQA multi-agent QA, V-Model paired test specs, Blueprint code review, Jira/Linear/Azure DevOps sync, Spec Sync drift detection, …). Every extension is a free product feature for spec-kit users. We don't have a community plane at all.

### 2.6. Native template overrides per project
`.specify/templates/overrides/` lets a team customize without forking. We don't have an equivalent layered override mechanism for skills or specs.

### 2.7. Brownfield framing is explicit
"Iterative Enhancement (Brownfield): add features incrementally, modernize legacy systems, adapt processes to existing codebases." Synchestra implicitly supports this but doesn't market it. Spec Kit names the use-case and ships templates for it.

---

## 3. Where Synchestra Is Stronger

These are advantages Spec Kit explicitly does not address.

### 3.1. Formal spec schema
SpecScore is a versioned, validated, lintable format. Spec Kit's "specs" are prose markdown with conventions but no machine-checked structure — `[NEEDS CLARIFICATION]` markers are a string convention, not a schema. *Anything Spec Kit produces could be made stricter by piping through SpecScore.*

### 3.2. Multi-agent coordination
Spec Kit assumes one agent, one session, one user. `/speckit.implement` is a single linear run. Synchestra's optimistic-locking state repo lets many agents on many machines pick tasks off a shared queue without stepping on each other. There is no equivalent in Spec Kit's model.

### 3.3. Async / remote execution (Hub)
Spec Kit's lifetime = your terminal. Close the laptop and the run dies. Synchestra Hub keeps execution running on a VM and resumes when you reconnect. Nothing in Spec Kit does this.

### 3.4. Hierarchical, recursive WBS
Spec Kit's task model is **flat per spec** — `tasks.md` is a single ordered list with `[P]` parallel markers. SpecScore tasks contain sub-tasks contain sub-sub-tasks; the directory tree *is* the work breakdown. For non-trivial work, flat task lists hit a wall.

### 3.5. State separated from product history
Spec Kit's state lives in `.specify/` inside the product repo, mixed with code commits. Synchestra splits state repo (`{project}-synchestra`) from code repo, so machine commits (claim, release, status, retry) don't pollute the product's git log.

### 3.6. inGitDB schema validation at commit time
Pre-commit, pre-push, and CI hooks reject malformed structure before it lands. Spec Kit relies on the agent to follow templates correctly; nothing rejects a malformed `tasks.md`.

### 3.7. Outstanding Questions as a first-class lifecycle
Persistent OQ blocks per directory survive across sessions and link to sub-tasks that resolve them. Spec Kit's `/speckit.clarify` produces a one-shot Clarifications section; it isn't a recurring lifecycle artifact.

### 3.8. CLI/MCP/file all valid for agents
Synchestra agents can use the CLI, the MCP server, or read/write files directly — three independent surfaces for the same state. Spec Kit's "agent surface" is the templated slash-command files in the agent's own command directory. If your runtime doesn't have slash commands, you don't have Spec Kit.

### 3.9. Tool-agnostic without per-agent install logic
Skills are markdown + a CLI binary; they work in any runtime that can read instructions and shell out. Spec Kit's per-agent install matrix is impressive *and* fragile — every new agent needs a maintained integration. SpecScore + Synchestra need neither.

### 3.10. Open standard the user keeps
If Spec Kit is abandoned, the user is left with `.specify/` markdown that no other tool understands. If Synchestra is abandoned, the user is left with a SpecScore tree that any tool can validate, render, or migrate. The substrate outlives the orchestrator by design.

## 4. Overlap Map: Where We Actually Compete

| Spec Kit surface | Synchestra-side equivalent | Real overlap? |
|---|---|---|
| `/speckit.specify` (write spec from prompt) | SpecScore feature template + `synchestra-feature-discover` skill | **Same job, different output.** Spec Kit produces prose; SpecScore produces structured spec. Solvable via a preset. |
| `/speckit.plan` (technical plan, data-model, contracts) | SpecScore plan + plan-template | **Same job.** Solvable via a preset. |
| `/speckit.tasks` (generate task list) | SpecScore tasks + `synchestra-task-new` | **Same job.** Plus Synchestra writes the tasks into a state repo with lifecycle. |
| `/speckit.implement` (run the tasks) | `synchestra` daemon + Hub | **Different jobs.** Spec Kit = single-session local; Synchestra = multi-agent async. Synchestra wins here, Spec Kit doesn't try. |
| `/speckit.constitution` | (no equivalent — gap to fill) | Gap on our side. Borrow it. |
| `/speckit.clarify` | Outstanding Questions + clarification skill | Partial. Spec Kit's structured-question UX is cleaner. |
| `/speckit.analyze` (cross-artifact consistency) | `specscore spec lint` + `synchestra-dream-lint` (planned) | We're stronger here once Dream ships. |
| `/speckit.checklist` | (no equivalent) | Minor gap. |
| Extensions API | (no equivalent) | Gap on our side. Big one. |
| Presets API | (no equivalent) | Gap on our side. |

**Read:** Five of seven Spec Kit core commands map cleanly onto SpecScore concepts. Two — `constitution` and `checklist` — are real ideas worth borrowing wholesale. Spec Kit's plugin architecture is a strict superset of what we have.

## 5. Integrate or Compete?

### The case for "compete"
- Spec Kit's spec format is informal; ours is rigorous. We can claim "the missing schema layer."
- Spec Kit can't do multi-agent or async; we can. We can claim "what comes after Spec Kit."
- We don't depend on GitHub's roadmap, Python tooling, or `uv`.
- A user fully bought into Synchestra doesn't need Spec Kit for anything Spec Kit uniquely provides — every step has a Synchestra-side equivalent.

### The case for "integrate"
- 92k stars vs. our pre-1.0 audience. Distribution arithmetic is unforgiving.
- Spec Kit users are already spec-driven by self-selection — they're our ideal upgrade audience.
- Spec Kit's plugin API is *exactly* the surface we'd want if we were designing a way for third parties to plug Synchestra in.
- The two products solve different layers: Spec Kit = author the spec, Synchestra = run the spec across agents over time. Stacking is natural.
- A `speckit-synchestra` extension is a 1–2 week build. Recreating Spec Kit's distribution is years.

### Recommendation: **Integrate, then differentiate on the substrate.**

Three concrete artifacts to ship into the Spec Kit ecosystem:

#### 5.1. `speckit-specscore` preset (★★★★★)
Override Spec Kit's `spec-template.md`, `plan-template.md`, `tasks-template.md` with SpecScore-structured equivalents. Add an `after_specify`/`after_plan`/`after_tasks` hook that runs `specscore spec lint` and reports drift. End state: every Spec Kit user produces machine-validatable SpecScore by default, without changing their workflow. This is **the single highest-leverage move** — it makes SpecScore the canonical output format of the most-used SDD toolkit.

#### 5.2. `speckit-synchestra` extension (★★★★★)
Adds:
- `speckit.synchestra.init` — initialize a Synchestra state repo alongside `.specify/`
- `speckit.synchestra.queue` — enqueue the tasks generated by `/speckit.tasks`
- `speckit.synchestra.claim|status|complete|release|handoff` — task lifecycle from inside the agent
- `speckit.synchestra.dispatch` — hand off to Hub for remote/async execution
- `after_tasks` hook with `optional: true, prompt: "Enqueue into Synchestra for parallel/async execution?"` — meets the user where Spec Kit leaves them

#### 5.3. `speckit-rehearse` extension (★★★★)
Adds `speckit.rehearse.run` and `speckit.rehearse.verify` so acceptance criteria written in `/speckit.specify` are actually executable. Hooks `after_implement` to verify before declaring done. Closes Spec Kit's biggest correctness gap: nothing in their flow tests the spec.

### Marketing positioning under this strategy

> *Spec Kit gets you from idea to spec. SpecScore makes the spec machine-readable. Synchestra runs it across as many agents and machines as you need. Use one, two, or all three — they compose.*

Spec Kit becomes our **acquisition channel**. SpecScore becomes the **format moat** (open standard). Synchestra becomes the **execution moat** (orchestration + Hub). We're not in their lane — we're the lane after theirs.

### What we lose by integrating

Honest accounting:
- Spec Kit users may never feel the need to graduate. If `/speckit.implement` works for them locally, they don't buy Hub.
- We become tied to Spec Kit's release cadence and breaking changes (manifest schema 1.0 today; 2.0 will rewrite the world).
- We can't position as "the spec-driven dev tool" while we're listed as "a spec-kit extension." Naming matters.
- If GitHub later ships their own state-repo / multi-agent feature, we're a distant second on their own platform.

These are real but manageable costs. The asymmetry of distribution makes the integrate-first strategy correct anyway.

## 6. Ideas Worth Borrowing

Ranked by value-per-effort.

### ★★★★★ Must-steal

**1. `/speckit.constitution` → SpecScore "project principles" artifact.**
A first-class top-level file that captures non-negotiable principles (security, performance, style, compliance) referenced by every later command. Currently Synchestra spreads this across CLAUDE.md, AGENTS.md, and skills — none of which is a single canonical artifact for *the project's principles*.
*Lands in:* SpecScore project definition spec; new optional `principles.md` at spec repo root.

**2. `/speckit.clarify` → first-class structured-clarification skill.**
Coverage-based questioning before planning. Synchestra has Outstanding Questions as a *storage* concept, but no skill that *generates* the questions interactively. Spec Kit's coverage approach is mechanically clean.
*Lands in:* new skill `synchestra-clarify` + `/sync-clarify` slash command.

**3. Plugin SPI in Synchestra.**
Spec Kit's `extension.yml` schema, namespaced commands, and pre/post hooks are exactly the plugin model Synchestra needs. Today our skills are plugin-shaped but not formally a plugin system — there's no manifest, no version constraint, no hook lifecycle, no registry.
*Lands in:* new feature `synchestra/plugins/` with manifest, registry, hook executor.

### ★★★★ High value

**4. Layered template overrides (`overrides/` → presets → extensions → core).**
Four-tier resolution priority for every template/skill/script. Lets organizations customize without forking. Synchestra's skills are currently flat.
*Lands in:* skills loader + spec template engine.

**5. Per-agent install matrix.**
`specify init --integration <agent>` writes the right files into the right place for 30+ agents. Synchestra needs equivalent install ergonomics for at least Claude Code, Cursor, Windsurf, and Codex.
*Lands in:* `synchestra install --agent <name>`.

**6. `/speckit.checklist` — generate quality validation checklists.**
On-demand domain-specific checklist from a spec (security, accessibility, performance). Light skill, big perceived value.
*Lands in:* new skill `synchestra-checklist`.

**7. `/speckit.analyze` — cross-artifact consistency check.**
Synchestra has the pieces (lint, deps, refs) but doesn't bundle them into a single "is this spec internally consistent?" verb.
*Lands in:* `synchestra analyze` command wrapping existing lints.

### ★★★ Worth considering

**8. Ship a Synchestra extension catalog modeled on Spec Kit's community-extensions index.**
Public registry of community skills, archetypes, presets. Lightweight (a curated README pointing at GitHub repos) but signals platform.

**9. `.specify/`-style state separation inside the product repo (alternative to a separate state repo).**
For users who really do not want a second repo, allow Synchestra to operate in a `.synchestra/` subdirectory. Trades audit-trail purity for onboarding ease. Already in flight as `embedded-state` plan — Spec Kit's success suggests it should be a supported mode, not a fallback.

**10. Brownfield templates / explicit modernization mode.**
Spec Kit names the brownfield use-case. Ship example SpecScore templates for "modernize a legacy module" and "add a feature to existing code" with the call-out in marketing.

### ★★ Nice to have

**11. Extension/preset distinction in our taxonomy.**
Spec Kit's split is clean: extensions *add* capabilities, presets *override* templates. If we ship a plugin SPI (idea #3), preserve this distinction.

**12. `requires.speckit_version`-style version constraints.**
Plugin manifests should declare which Synchestra/SpecScore versions they target. Cheap to add, expensive to retrofit.

└─────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────┘
```

Different layers. Stackable. The layer Spec Kit *doesn't* solve (substrate, multi-agent, async, portability) is the layer where SpecScore + Synchestra are uniquely positioned to win.

The biggest strategic risk is **not** Spec Kit eating Synchestra's category — it's Synchestra refusing to integrate, getting outcompeted at top-of-funnel, and arriving at the substrate fight without the audience that already self-selected as spec-driven.

### Recommended priorities (next 4–8 weeks)

1. **Ship `speckit-specscore` preset** — replace prose templates with SpecScore-structured ones; add `after_*` lint hooks. *(1–2 weeks)*
2. **Ship `speckit-synchestra` extension** — `claim|status|complete|queue|dispatch` commands + `after_tasks` hook. *(2 weeks)*
3. **Ship `speckit-rehearse` extension** — make ACs executable from the Spec Kit flow. *(1 week)*
4. **Add `/sync-constitution` and `/sync-clarify`** to match Spec Kit's authoring-side rituals. *(1 week)*
5. **Spec out a Synchestra plugin SPI** modeled on Spec Kit's `extension.yml` — same manifest shape, same hook taxonomy, same namespacing. Eventual goal: a plugin author can target Spec Kit *and* Synchestra with one manifest. *(2–3 weeks design + spec)*
6. **Update marketing** to position Synchestra as "the substrate Spec Kit produces specs for." Mention Spec Kit by name. Don't compete; compose.

See [`extension-integration.md`](extension-integration.md) for the concrete `extension.yml` manifests and hook wiring for steps 1–3.
